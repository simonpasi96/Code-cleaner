# Code-cleaner
This is a tool to format code from the Unity Editor. It does things that Visual Studio doesn't, eg enforce ifs without brackets, remove unnecessary private keywords, remove some regions, etc.

## How-to:
* Copy-paste some code into the Code Cleaner window (or click-and-drag a text file into the Open File area).
* Right click inside of the window to run a cleaner.
* When you're finished, copy-paste the code from the Code Cleaner window back into your file.
